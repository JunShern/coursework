This case was the first to define sexual assault as a form of sexual discrimination, as defined by Title IX, the US anti-discrimination law. Alexander v.

I was so grateful to my mum and dad for teaching me everything I need to know about love. After the speech I was congratulated and everyone celebrated. At 3am in the morning I had to wake up and get a taxi to Heathrow airport because I was going to Brazil for the world cup! I travelled around Brazil, Uruguay &amp; Argentina by myself when I was only 18 and I have the most incredible story of how I managed to get home without any money or a valid flight ticket.

I have been working on something called From School to Success that aims to help close the gap between success in school and success in life. If knowledge is power then education is the gift that gives us the power we need to innovate out of our problems and keep on moving forwards in all walks of life. When I volunteered in Nepal for 3 months I spent lots of time teaching and working in schools, the level of education they received there was heartbreaking to tell the truth. In addition to this, I find my younger brothers very disengaged with school in the UK and I believe that school should help young people to &#39;fall in love with learning&#39; because as I have tried to explain to my brothers now I&#39;ve left school I absolutely love learning about everything!</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c5"><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How would you title your talk?</span></p></td><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Information Age</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c5"><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What subject(s) or issue(s) does your talk pertain to?</span></p></td><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The subject would be the day and age we live in, the issue would be focused on the direction in which we are heading.

I have many stories of actively facing my fears, with a big one occurring just last year. I wanted to explore our fear of scarcity and addiction to material possessions. To do this, I gave away almost all my possessions &ndash; an entire house full of furniture, kitchenware and clothing &ndash; and kept only the irreplaceable mementos from my life.

I was repeatedly rejected again but, finally, received an offer from Huddersfield. I worked hard to get into masters at Imperial. After completion, I applied for jobs and came close. But, it was not destined for me thus, causing major depression. Then, I reevaluated myself and thought about working on my interests.

Both sides of the road were littered with run down dwellings, people and starving animals. In the middle of the road I suddenly saw what looked like a line of newspaper, with large rocks placed at either end.

Returning much later that day after having collected to what amounted to three sacks of Pelican feathers I saw that the newspaper had blown away revealing a corpse, guarded only by the strategically placed rocks at head and foot. I was later informed that this was a common way for poor families to dispose of their deceased. They would be collected up by a communal lorry and then placed in a mass grave.

One memorable anecdote was the day I was able to swim with whale sharks. After hours of waiting on board of a small boat, the biologist in charge screamed &lsquo;jump!&rsquo;, and all of a sudden I found myself swimming among enormous whale sharks whilst crying tears of happiness.

The &ldquo;Tiki Love Truck&rdquo; - Amador&rsquo;s mobile mosaic mausoleum has since travelled the UK and was the star exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum&rsquo;s &lsquo;Disobedient Objects&rsquo; show. Making this vehicle, not only allowed me to keep my sanity whilst going to the darkest of places &ndash; but more importantly has helped to express the humanity in all of us. Art can create a space for a dialogue where before there was none- I believe it is the best tool we have for social unity.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c5"><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you could change one thing globally, what would it be and why?</span></p></td><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I would wish to end inequality &ndash; for all citizens of the world to have the same rights, same opportunities and same access to getting their basic needs met.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Financial insecurity makes slaves of us all and usually ends in war.

While I was in Zambia, I witnessed first-hand the violence and abuse which have, sadly, been the norm in Lusaka for as long as any of the people I spoke to could remember. I, myself, was the victim of this violence. However, in the wake of my first experience of a violent incident, I was overwhelmed by the kindness and strength of Zambians I barely knew, or with whom I had a merely professional relationship. Their unbreakable spirit and drive, in the aftermath of their history as survivors of violence and abuse, taught me more than I ever thought I could learn.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c5"><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you could change one thing globally, what would it be and why?</span></p></td><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I have made it my life&rsquo;s mission to address the root causes of inequality in the world.

Upon entering and seeing the well-composed, sharp and colourful images of wildlife around the world, I genuinely felt as if I was standing in each specific location at the moment each image was shot. As I walked from image to image, I felt more and more excited and I do not recall any other moment in my life when I was wholeheartedly amazed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I realize that this is very short of an anecdote, and that there was not much active interaction at the time, in this case with the animals, but I have developed my passion and care for wildlife ever since I visited a part of the Amazon rainforest at the age of 8.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My mom took my brothers and I on a trip around some parts Peru, and I vividly remember entering the Amazon, looking around me to make sure an anaconda was not around, and as I looked up at one point, I came across a large blue butterfly, its wing span about the width of my chest, or even more due to its distance from the ground. Where I lived in Lima, there was not much wildlife around besides the domestic pets, but this aspect of my environment changed when I moved to Sint Maarten at the age of 11.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I remember looking forward to seeing turtles as I travelled, but at that age I had not realized that I would be in for a bigger treat. In my backyard, I met lizards of various species, butterflies, spiders and sugar birds. Throughout the island I came across iguanas, colourful insects, and may birds species. Moreover, I feel fortunate for my dad being a certified diving instructor, as I had the opportunity to snorkel and dive regularly. Underwater, I encountered shrimps, crabs, lobsters, many fish species, octopi, urchins, and even sharks. Oh, and turtles!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From my dad, I learned how to handle and behave around animals like sharks and stingrays, who can be largely misunderstood creatures at times, as well as to respect their home (underwater) by not dropping garbage, and actually picking up after others, mainly tourists who threw bottles or plastic overboard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I now think about wildlife, the first thing that pops into my mind is how I felt as I viewed the images of the exhibition, and I am reminded of why I felt that way from the many previous experiences of my life.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c5"><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you could change one thing globally, what would it be and why?</span></p></td><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Recently, I have spent some time watching videos and reading articles about what is happening in Syria and why.

And actually, I want to. I cannot explain it, but I just do. So as I continue to learn more about the crisis, I also share with my peers and engage in discussion to learn more from them as well as share my opinion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When considering how the war began, at the time of peaceful protests before fire was opened on the protesters, I ask myself, &ldquo;What if those shots were not initially fired?

Was he?&rdquo; I realize that I may be asking the wrong questions as I have more reading to do.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nonetheless, I have already been told by my friends that this is idealistic thinking, and that in reality, no peaceful solution exists. But if I could change ONE thing about what is happening in Syria, but also in the rest of the world, is for every single one of us to be more understanding of another.
